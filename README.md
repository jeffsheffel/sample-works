# Sample Works of Jeff Sheffel
## February 2, 2017

There are 66 files, of sample works, that are included in this repository... don't worry, they are organized, and you can simply peruse the ones of interest.

The sample works are:
- organized in subdirectories:
    - code
    - dotfile
    - etc
- purely authored by Jeff Sheffel (except in a few cases where noted)
- demonstrate a diversity in application
- part of recent work projects (within the last 4 years)
- an attempt to show brief and concise sample works, which was a challenge, considering large project sizes in a collaborative team setting

The associated documentation, for the various company projects, is contained in the `etc/doc` directory (and not within each `code` subdirectory).
